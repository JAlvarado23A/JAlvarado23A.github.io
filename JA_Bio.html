<h2>Mini Bio</h2>
<p> I am a father of two young children: a boy and a girl. My son is 3 and is very inquisitive. My daughter is 1 and likes to beat up her brother. I live in Anaheim and work in South-Central Los Angeles. I am an assistant principal for Kory Hunter Middles School. 
<br>
On my spare time, I enjoy working around the house, reading, and playing with my children. I enjoy gardening and building stuff for my son (i.e. sandboxes, clubhouses, and other things his imagination gets excited about). We enjoy running around playing soccer, baseball, and just swinging on the swing.
